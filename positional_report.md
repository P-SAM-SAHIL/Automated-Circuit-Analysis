## Interpretation Notes

### High Probe Accuracy (>0.7)
Indicates the head reliably represents the predicted feature in its activations.

### High Adversarial KL (>0.5)
The head significantly affects output distribution even on OOD inputs - strong causal role.

### High Intervention Effect (>0.3)
Custom interventions produce measurable effects - confirms causal importance.

### High Faithfulness (>0.5)
Activation patching shows the head is causally necessary for the behavior.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate top-scoring circuits in detail
2. Test on additional task-specific datasets
3. Extend to deeper circuit analysis (3+ component interactions)
4. Compare findings with manual interpretability research
